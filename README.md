# Cat Fighter Game

## The best game you will ever play.

Cat Fighter Game is a game where users will be able to 
collect cats with varying rarities. Each cat has
unique stats and users will be able to feed them, 
upgrade them during fights, and customize their names.
These cats are born to fight. Users will be able to
build up their cat fighter team to compete against
**bots** and use items in-round to buff their 
cats' stats. This game is geared towards those who
enjoy cats and fighter games who are looking for
a game to collect cute characters. I personally like 
cats and I want to create a game that has a similar
functionality to the *Pok√©mon* games as I grew up
playing them.
